def colored_line(x, y, c, ax, **lc_kwargs):
    """
    Plot a line with a color specified along the line by a third value.

    It does this by creating a collection of line segments. Each line segment is
    made up of two straight lines each connecting the current (x, y) point to the
    midpoints of the lines connecting the current point with its two neighbors.
    This creates a smooth line with no gaps between the line segments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array-like
        The horizontal and vertical coordinates of the data points.
    c : array-like
        The color values, which should be the same size as x and y.
    ax : Axes
        Axis object on which to plot the colored line.
    **lc_kwargs
        Any additional arguments to pass to matplotlib.collections.LineCollection

    Returns

    matplotlib.collections.LineCollection
